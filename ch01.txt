need to be scared
Where are you from?
Are you lost?

Ah, right!

That day at the shrine I made a secret friend 

Because her tails curled up
ーThat's it

# pg 15
Her nameー

# pg 16
10 years later

sfx: suuu... 

.....
Tasuku....!

# pg 17
Hey
Don't lose focus
Ah, sorry
This is an important talk about your future so pay attention, Shibasaki

Right, as for your first choice
With your grades it shouldn't pose a problem

# pg 18
But you just chose a nearby school that suits your academic ability
Is that a problem?

But don't you like animals? 
You found something you really like so you shouldn't let it go to waste

Like a veterinarian or caretaker at a zoo or seeing-eye dog trainer for example

A dream job... Do you have something like that?
There are many kinds of occupations to chose from

# pg 19
Just a normal office employee... Like my parents

Properly listen to the teacher ー（｀ー｀）ノ
...

Hey!
Yes

Lets end it here
Enjoy the vacation and don't forget to study 
sfx: slide
Yes

Could you call Kaitani for me?

# pg 20
Are you done?

Y-yes

Seeing-eye dog trainer
I think that's nice 

# pg 21
She heard...

sfx: *bzz*

# pg 22
Did you do it properly? Because you're always so absentminded, big brother!
From where was she watching?
small: Always

Back then, I felt like I as being called by someone...
Huh?
There is something in my pocket?

# pg 23
This...

That day at the shrine
Her tails curled up
Tails...?

Tasuku...!!

# pg 24
That's rightー
Kyururu

Tasuku help...!!

Kyururu is calling!!

# pg 25
sfx: *OoOoOoO* (ominous atmospheric noise) 

# pg 26-27
sfx: *punch*

# pg 28
!!?

Marika
And Kaitani...!?
Why are you two...
sfx: scrape

Ears...?
Tail?

# pg 29
sfx: sudden
sfx: whoosh

sfx: *wham*
sfx: *thud*

sfx: fighting noises (T/N: insert your own generic sfx)

Why did a gate suddenly appear here 

Hey, don't get close to the goods
Stay out of the ring
sfx: picks up
Whoa

# pg 30
Two new Cafus just arrived today
They make for good companions when hunting sandworms

Cafus?

I can't get serious fighting a fellow Cafus
That's why you'll lose!

Ears and tail...
They look just like Marika and Kaitani... It has to be someone else, right?

Wait a minute, this isn't the shrine!

# pg 31
You came from *another*, right?
I've heard something like that before
I don't know what causes a gate to appear, though

Do you understand my words?

!?

Waaaah
sfx: run

# pg 32-33
-

# pg 34
*haahh*
What the hell is this place
*haahh*

Those ears and tail
Maybe Kyururu...

# pg 35
Someone catch her!
sfx: *whoosh*

# pg 36
sfx: jump

?

sfx: roll roll
sfx: crash

sfx: *jerk* 

sfx: *thud*
Kaitani... No, the girl from...
Are you alright?


Restrain her! That's a brutal Cafus!
She hurt a human!
eh?

# pg 37
I'll catch her!
sfx: slide

Why?
Why did you push the vendor and run away?
Come back before it becomes a serious incident!

Call the guards!
....
Surround Her!

# pg 38
Because I can't go home

That's why I'll fight you seriously

# pg 39
cardbord box: Kyururu's home
Hey Kyururu
It's lonely at night here 
small: Though I made a home, but out here...

Won't come over to my house?
I'll introduce you to my sister. I'm sure you'll get along

# pg 40-41
After all, If I'm here
Then I...
Might be able to hear my master's voice 

# pg 42
Right now I don't know how to get home, but I'm sure...

sfx: screech

sfx: pull

# pg 44
Well done
sfx: step step
It can't be helped, We'll get complaints if sell goods with a problematic disposition 
Hand her over to the guards

That's right

sfx: chatter chatter
Tie her up while she's down
She might attack again
She's dangerous 

# pg 45
Ah, I almost forgot
sfx: rustle

Kyururu recovered with this
She even powered up

Though it's just some hard candy
No way

# pg 46
It...
It was the kiss!?

There's no way that's it
sfx: shake shake
?
....

# pg 47
sfx: Thump 
sfx: Thump

sfx: rumble
The guard is here
Clear the way
sfx: THUMP

# pg 48-49

# pg 50
sfx: swipe

They're taking her away
If you cooperate with I'll help you rescue her

Will you help her...
Or lets her die? 

small: What is the crisis that the girl accompanies...


### Translator Notes

* Kyururu
Tasuku uses *kyuru* (キュル) to say that her tail curled up. Hence the connection between her tail curling up and her name.

* Another (page 31)
The girl literally asks Tasuku whether he comes from "Another". Another is written in katakana (アナザー).
