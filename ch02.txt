### pg 1
If you wish to let her die just keep sitting there

But that girl got eaten by a giant lizard
She wasn't eaten, they just took her away

To Karendra

Follow me
If you do I'll tell you how you can go back to your world

That's right I have to go
But 
This *kid* is aー

### pg 2
Shorty?

The savior is  beautiful little girl
sfx: ta-dah

Chapter 2:  Caretaking

### pg 3
If a Cafus lays just as much as scratch on a person they'll get disposed off
Disposed
But there is a way to help

Even if she's taken away she won't be killed immediately 
She will be inspected if her aptitude is recognized she will receive necessary treatment 
If a caretaker appears she'll can be saved

A caretaker

Thenー
Don't get flustered 

### pg 4
I'm Leoni 
Leoni Rottweiler 
This one is Rufaus, my travel companion

And you?
Tasuku Shibasaki
small: An axolotl?

I saw the place beyond the gate, you came from *another*
I'm sure you know nothing about this world
I'll tell you all about it. You must be lucky to have met me

### pg 5
Gate?
Another?
I'm sure you have lots of questions but before that

What a disaster I just got my hands on some good Cafus

I'll just have to sell you for an extra high price

We're going back to the ring
sfx: pull

### pg 6
Please wait a moment
I'll take that Cafus off your hands

What about 3 magic stones?

Ah? 
Don't you have cash? 300K Zuuna
You can live lavishly for one week with that amount

...
...
...
With that girl's money...

So that'll be sufficient?
yea, it's enough not to get killed 

### pg 7
...

well
Let's escape... I mean 
Let's go, you two 

### pg 8
Now we need to gather some equipment
Weren't we gonna save that girl

Preparations are needed 

And you'll help me out
Your job is to take care of the Cafus

Cafus can't use their hands
They completely rely on people as they can't do anything on their own
The owner takes responsibility for everything necessary for living

Now that I think about it Kyururu couldn't use her hands either...

### pg 9
When I was a child I often got told
If you can't take care of them don't get them
Well lately you don't see strays all that often anymore

I have my own stuff to deal with so you'll look after the Cafus
You're okay with that, right?
Cafus...
Anyway let's go 
You'll see some other fighting Cafus on the way 

Ah, I almost forgot... We have to pick a name

I'll leave that up to you

### pg 10
sfx: *walk straight past*

sfx: *run*
For now lets catch up

### pg 11
Really... Just what is this place
Can I really return to my world?

Having a familiar face with me somehow makes me feel relieved 

No
It's someone else

Because whenever I walked with Marika 
She would always cling to me 

And the girl that got taken away looks just like my classmate
like Kaitani

Dispose
sfx: shudder

### pg 12
These Cafus have quite the leg strength
It's nothing to be afraid if you bring the necessary equipment 

sfx: whoosh

sfx: Wham

### pg 13
Your ideal partner
They fight with their life for your sake

Come find an unspoiled soul just for you
Get your one and only unique Cafus right hereー

Keep watching here for a while
I'll go buy an equipment set in the shop

### pg 14
You
You do battles too, right
uhｈ...
She said decide on a name but doesn't she already have one?

If you don't decide a name quickly I'll be troubled
That's right I'm sorry 
Wow. Even her voice sounds like Marika

I might call her Marika by accident. I have to decide quickly
But...

It's frustration
eh...?

### pg 15
They say Cafus can't do anything on their own
That might be so but...

My previous... master was much gentler 
He treated us with care...

I loved reading picture books together
Every day taking baths together and sleeping in the same bed
Always brushing me carefully...

You 
You're being forced to take of me but can you really do it properly?
sfx: growl
....
small: you

### pg 16
What happened with your previous owner?
....
....

Ah
This is something I shouldn't ask
Something must have happened

I... haven't been... thrown away 

....
What should I do
the mood suddenly became all gloomy 

### pg 17
Good you're still here

I'm bought everything I need lets return to the inn
follow me

### pg 18
You look like you've never seen a Cafus before 
Does something like Cafus not exist in Another?

Another is what we call the world where you come from
You came through a gate, right?
That was a gate?

Then
Do you know magic?

Magic exists here too...

### page 19
I'm glad the ordered equipment and accessories arrived here too 

It's cheap soap but whatever

I'll leave the rest up to you
I have some more errands to run

The rest... Just what do you want me to do

### pg 20
Can't you do anything without me telling every single thing?
sfx: sigh 

This is the bathroom
It isn't a communal one so it's a little narrow but bear with it

Take of those filthy pieces of cloth and strip her naked
And thoroughly wash her whole body with soap
 
Ah please use this soap (cheap)
But doing that to a girl...

### pg 21
Ah, be careful
Don't remove her arm device

Or else she'll go wild 

Well then I'll be back soon
I'll install her new arm device afterwards
Until I get back clean her up

Bath
Quick

### pg 22
sfx: dip

Taking an unknown subservient girl home 
I wonder if it's something like this

errr...
If I don't pick a name I won't know how to call her

Hey you, bath's ready

she listened to "hey you"

### pg 23
-

### pg 24
She told me not to remove them but if you don't take them off I can't wash you
they'll definitely break

Put your hand on my shoulder

Like this?
sfx: glow

### pg 25
sfx: *pop*
sfx: appear

To go wild... I don't understand but
A key?
Magic?
Nothing happened to Kyururu
...
sfx: click click

### pg 26
This is Marika

This isn't wrong. Marika and I always took baths together when we were children

Therefore there is nothing wrong with doing this!!
sfx: trembling 

### pg 27
uhh, a towel 
I should have prepared it beforehand 
Anyhow if I just make lots of bubbles to hide it
sfx: dip

I'll wash your body now
Hey
sfx: rub rub

Don't use such a stiff cloth. I want you to do it carefully with your hands 
If you use that on my armpits or back of the knee
It will hurt. so DON'T 

How selfish
Quickly

doing it with my hand is a bit...

### pg 28
Do you hate touching me that much
Am I dirty?

It's not like that
It's just...

I
understand

Then, your head...

There is just a small difference so don't treat me like a child

### pg 29
She's been in a dusty place the whole time
I'll have to wash her thoroughly 
...alright

### pg 30
sfx slide slide

sfx: slide slide

sfx: slide slide

...
sigh

sfx: slip
??
Whoa

eh?

### pg 31
sfx: thud
sfx: splash

### pg 32
I'm sorry
Are you okay Marika

Marika...?
*thump*
Is that my name?

### pg 33
hnn
sfx: *thump*
sfx: *twitch*

ha
ha
sfx: *thump* (lots of them)

### pg 34
Say my name once more 
And gently stroke my head
Hold me tight
small: ha

!

sfx: blush
....

Water will enter my eyes to quickly dry me!
I grazed my knee so be gentle!
My tail soaked plenty so soap it up with shampoo

How demanding

side: has the naked bonding been effective?

### Translation notes

#### Magic stone
Full translation is "Magic gallstone" (魔胆石). I kept it as "magic stone" because I felt that flowed better. 

#### Arm device
Literal translation "equipment arm" (装備アーム)
